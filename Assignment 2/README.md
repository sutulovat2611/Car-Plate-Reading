# Car-Plate-Reading
All the steps for car plate detection are performed in assignment2.py file, where both algorithms may be found (algorithm1() and algorithm2()).
In order to test either of the sets, please follow these steps:
1. Clear the results from the results folder
2. Fill up the set 1 and set 2 folders with the required pictures
3. Uncomment the needed lines of code under __main__ function
4. Run the code
5. Clear the results folder again if you wish to repeat the car plate detection

**Please do not test both sets simultaneously since it may affect the final result due to the naming of the images.
